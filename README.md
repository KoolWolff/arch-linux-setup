# archlinux-setup
This scripts are a collection of all the steps I do when I install Arch Linux. As it's always nearly the same process, I've written the steps down as bash scripts.

Kudos to Swapnil Bhartiya, his Arch Linux setup guide is the base for all the scripts: http://www.muktware.io/arch-linux-guide-the-always-up-to-date-arch-linux-tutorial

## Important
The scripts are not meant to be cloned and executed without attention. If you use the scripts, read each script carefully and edit each single file to your needs. I left some comments in the scripts to group things together optically.
